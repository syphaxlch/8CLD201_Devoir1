# **Azure VM Deployment with Load Balancer and Autoscaling**

## **Overview**
This project automates the deployment of an Azure infrastructure consisting of two Virtual Machines (VMs) behind a **Load Balancer** with **autoscaling** capabilities.  
The configuration is fully managed through **Azure DevOps YAML pipelines**, and the source code is hosted on **GitHub**.  
The infrastructure is deployed using **ARM templates**, with all secrets securely stored in **Azure Key Vault**.

## **Objective**
The main goal of this project is to gain **hands-on experience with YAML pipelines in Azure DevOps** by building a complete CI/CD process to:
- Automatically deploy a scalable infrastructure on Azure  
- Implement load balancing using Azure Load Balancer  
- Enable autoscaling based on CPU utilization
